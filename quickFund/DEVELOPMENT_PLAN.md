# Next.js Full-Stack Project Development Plan

This document outlines a step-by-step plan for building a production-quality Next.js application (like QuickFund) from scratch. Follow each phase to master modern full-stack development. **You will write all code yourself, using this as your guide.**

---

## 1. Project Planning & Requirements
- List all required features (public pages, user dashboard, admin dashboard, authentication, etc).
- Sketch user flows (how users/admins interact with the app).
- Decide on tech stack: Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, TailwindCSS, state management (Zustand/Context), API client (fetch/axios), etc.

## 2. Project Setup
- Initialize a new Next.js app with TypeScript:
  ```bash
  npx create-next-app@latest --typescript
  ```
- Set up TailwindCSS (follow official docs).
- Set up ESLint, Prettier, and Husky for code quality.
- Configure absolute imports in `tsconfig.json` (e.g., `@/` paths).

## 3. Directory Structure
- Use the `/app` directory (App Router).
- Organize code into:
  - `/app` (routes/pages)
  - `/components` (reusable UI)
  - `/lib` (API, helpers, stores, types)
  - `/public` (static assets)
- Plan for scalability and separation of concerns.

## 4. Core Layout & Theming
- Create a global layout (header, footer, main content area).
- Add global styles (Tailwind base, custom CSS variables if needed).
- Set up metadata for SEO and social sharing.

## 5. Authentication & Authorization
- Choose an auth method (JWT, NextAuth.js, or OAuth2).
- Implement an auth context/provider to store user info and tokens.
- Protect routes using guards/HOCs for user/admin areas.

## 6. Routing & Navigation
- Set up public pages: Home, About, FAQs, Login, Signup, Terms.
- Set up user routes: Dashboard, Apply, Loans, Repayment, Agreement.
- Set up admin routes: Dashboard, Applications, Repayments, Export.

## 7. API Layer
- Create API clients in `/lib/api/` for backend communication.
- Handle errors and loading states globally.

## 8. State Management
- Use Context or Zustand for auth, notifications, and global state.
- Keep local state in components where possible.

## 9. Feature Development (Iterative)
- Start with core flows:
  - User registration/login
  - Loan application
  - Loan dashboard
  - Admin review/approval
- Add secondary features:
  - Repayments
  - Notifications
  - PDF/CSV export

## 10. Testing
- Write unit tests for helpers, API, and logic.
- Write component tests for UI (Jest + React Testing Library).
- Write E2E tests for critical flows (Cypress/Playwright).

## 11. Performance & Accessibility
- Optimize images and assets.
- Use Lighthouse to check performance and accessibility.
- Add semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.

## 12. Deployment & DevOps
- Dockerize the app.
- Set up CI/CD (GitHub Actions).
- Deploy to Vercel, AWS, or another cloud provider.

## 13. Documentation
- Write a clear README.
- Document architecture decisions and trade-offs.

## 14. Iterate & Polish
- Gather feedback.
- Refactor for clarity and maintainability.
- Polish UI/UX.

**Use this plan as your roadmap. For each step, ask for guidance, best practices, or explanations as needed. You will write all code yourself for maximum learning.**
