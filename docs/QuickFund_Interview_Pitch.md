# QuickFund Interview Pitch

## Project Intro

> **QuickFund is a full-stack, production-ready micro-lending platform I built for the Simbrella job challenge. The goal was to design a secure, scalable, and user-friendly system that allows users to apply for micro-loans, have their applications scored automatically, and enables admins to review and manage loans.  
> 
> The stack is modern and robust: the backend is built with NestJS, Prisma, and PostgreSQL, while the frontend uses Next.js, React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. Everything is containerized with Docker and orchestrated via Docker Compose, and I’ve set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions for automated testing, migrations, and deployment.  
> 
> I focused on clean architecture, strong security (including hybrid JWT/session authentication and RBAC), and a smooth developer experience. I also documented the system thoroughly and ensured that both local and CI/CD environments are reliable and reproducible.**

## Workthrough Pitch Soundbites

### 1. Architecture & Stack
> “I chose a modular, service-oriented architecture. The backend is a NestJS REST API with Prisma ORM for type-safe database access and migrations. The frontend is a Next.js SPA, using Zustand for state management. Docker Compose ties everything together, making onboarding and deployment seamless.”

---

### 2. Authentication & Security
> “Authentication uses a hybrid approach: JWTs for stateless API access, sessions for persistent login, and refresh tokens for secure rotation. All tokens are stored in httpOnly cookies to prevent XSS. I implemented RBAC to restrict admin features, and followed best practices for password hashing and input validation.”

---

### 3. Loan Application & Scoring
> “Users can apply for loans through a simple, guided form. The backend scores applications automatically based on configurable criteria, and stores the results in the database. This logic is modular, so scoring rules can be updated easily.”

---

### 4. Admin Dashboard
> “Admins have a dedicated dashboard to review, approve, or reject loan applications. The dashboard is protected by RBAC, and all sensitive actions are logged. The UI is designed for clarity and efficiency, using TailwindCSS for a modern look.”

---

### 5. DevOps & CI/CD
> “I set up Docker for local development and production parity. The CI/CD pipeline runs tests, builds images, applies database migrations, and seeds initial data. This ensures every environment is consistent and reliable.”

---

### 6. Database & Migrations
> “Prisma handles schema migrations and type-safe queries. I use Docker volumes for persistent storage, so data isn’t lost between container restarts. Migrations and seed scripts run automatically on startup, both locally and in CI/CD.”

---

### 7. Error Handling & Testing
> “I implemented global error handling in the backend, with clear API responses. The frontend displays user-friendly error messages. I wrote unit and integration tests for critical paths, and the CI pipeline enforces test coverage.”

---

### 8. Trade-offs & Improvements
> “Given the time constraints, I prioritized core features and security. With more time, I’d add more granular permissions, advanced analytics, and more comprehensive test coverage. The architecture is designed to be easily extensible.”

## Closing Soundbite

> “Overall, QuickFund demonstrates my ability to deliver a secure, maintainable, and production-ready system end-to-end, with a focus on clean code, strong DevOps, and a great user experience.”
